      <h1>Privacy Policy for Google Extension - HighLight</h1>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The HighLight extension allows users to highlight selected text on a
        webpage with a variety of colors. This Privacy Policy explains what
        information we collect when you use this Extension, how we use that
        information, and your rights regarding your data.
      </p>

      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        The Extension itself does <strong>not</strong> collect any personally
        identifiable information (PII) from users. The Extension only interacts
        with the text you select on a webpage for the purpose of highlighting.
        However, it may store certain preferences locally within your browser
        using Chrome's local storage.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Specifically, the Extension may store:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Highlighting Preferences</strong>: The selected highlight
          color is stored temporarily during the browsing session but is not
          retained after the session ends.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Selected Text</strong>: When you select text, it is
          highlighted with the chosen color, but the selected text is not saved
          or transmitted anywhere.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Keyboard Shortcuts</strong>: The Extension listens for keydown
          events (e.g., "Ctrl + H") to trigger the text highlighting function.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Use of Data</h2>
      <p>The Extension uses local resources within your browser to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Highlight selected text</strong>: Using the “Ctrl + H”
          shortcut, the Extension highlights the selected text with a random
          color from the predefined list.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Remove existing highlights</strong>: If selected text has
          already been highlighted, the Extension will remove the existing
          highlight before applying a new one.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This data is not persisted beyond the current browser session and is not
        accessible after the session is closed.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Retention</h2>
      <p>
        All settings and preferences are stored temporarily within your browser.
        The Extension does not transmit any data to external servers or
        databases. Highlighting data is cleared once you close or reload the
        webpage.
      </p>

      <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        This Extension does not use any third-party analytics, tracking
        services, or external APIs that collect or transmit your personal data.
      </p>

      <h2>User Control</h2>
      <p>
        You have full control over the settings and behavior of this Extension.
        You can:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Disable or remove highlights</strong>: By selecting
          highlighted text again and using the Extension, previous highlights
          will be removed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Uninstall the Extension</strong>: Uninstalling the Extension
          will remove all functionality, and no further data will be stored.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>
        All data used by the Extension is stored securely within Chrome’s local
        storage. The Extension does not transmit data over the internet,
        minimizing the risk of unauthorized access. However, you are responsible
        for maintaining the security of your device and browser.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If any changes are
        made, we will notify users by updating the date at the top of the
        policy. Continued use of the Extension after any updates constitutes
        acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy.
      </p>
